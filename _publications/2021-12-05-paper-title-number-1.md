In this paper, we study the mass distribution of elementary fermions and find a set of empirical relations to describe the mass distribution of elementary fermions. This inspires us to investigate in depth the origin of elementary fermion mass hierarchies and generations. We present a theoretical model to explain why the elementary fermions have three generations and discuss the origin of the fundamental fermion mass hierarchies and spin.
